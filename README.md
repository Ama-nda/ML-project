# 📈 Retail Sales Analysis & Predictive Modeling

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting actionable insights from over 10,000 retail transaction records. By leveraging **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning**, I developed a system to predict customer spending behavior and classify purchase categories. This helps businesses optimize inventory management and refine marketing strategies.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features
* **Advanced Data Cleaning:** * Automated handling of missing values and duplicate records.
    * Outlier detection and removal using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method for 'Price Per Unit' and 'Total Spent'.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** * Visualizing sales trends and category performance using Matplotlib.
    * Identifying top-performing product segments and payment method preferences.
* **Predictive Modeling:**
    * **Regression:** Forecasting `Total Spent` to predict customer lifetime value.
    * **Classification:** Predicting transaction `Category` and `Payment Method` based on purchase behavior.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib

## 📊 Results & Evaluation
* **Regression:** Evaluated via 'Predicted vs. Actual' scatter plots to ensure model reliability.
* **Classification:** Validated using **Confusion Matrices** and **ROC Curves** to measure precision and recall across different product categories.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `machine (1) (1).ipynb`: Full end-to-end Python implementation.
* `retail_store_sales.csv`: Source dataset used for analysis.
