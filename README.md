Retail Sales Analysis & Predictive Modeling
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail store sales data to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and category performance. It utilizes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning to build predictive models for both business forecasting and customer classification.

🚀 Key Features
Data Cleaning: Comprehensive handling of raw, "dirty" data, including missing value imputation, duplicate removal, and outlier detection using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of sales trends over time and performance analysis across different product categories.

Predictive Modeling:

Regression: Predicting the Total Spent by customers to forecast revenue.

Classification: Predicting categorical outcomes such as Payment Method or product Category.

Visualization: Detailed boxplots and scatter plots to visualize data distribution and model performance (Predicted vs. Actual).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: * Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation.

Matplotlib for data visualization.

Scikit-Learn for machine learning algorithms and evaluation.

📊 How it Works
Preprocessing: Irrelevant columns like Transaction ID and Customer ID are removed to focus on predictive features.

Model Training: Employs algorithms such as Random Forest and Linear Regression.

Evaluation: Models are evaluated using Confusion Matrices, ROC Curves for classification, and scatter plots for regression accuracy.
